[9] “Contributing \n","factors included disruption to food shopping and food availability, gyms being closed leading to fear around body changes, \n","inability to receive face-to-face support, home isolations, increased exposure to food which may have resulted in bingeing \n","or not eating, and comparison to others while being stuck at home,” says Nichols.

[10] Faced with an economic \n","downturn and a cost-of-living crisis, it’s no wonder that people find it hard to stay healthy in what they eat and how they \n","stay active. Fresh food is expensive and time consuming to make, and people are increasingly tired from the more they \n","have to work. Making fresh and healthy food may therefore be getting harder and harder to manage. [11]\n","\n","\"To make food from scratch is both time consuming and is financially harder too,” says Talia Carvajal – head pastry chef at \n","Hart in Copenhagen. “While it’s proven that cooking from scratch, with all the right ingredients is, in the long run, more cost \n","effective because a lot of ingredients can be used time and time again, the mental effort it takes to work out how to cook \n","a balanced meal, make something different with similar ingredients each night, finding the desire to eat leftovers often \n","seems like far more work than a pre-prepared meal, which is only marginally more expensive. Of course pre-prepared \n","meals containhigher salt, higher saturated fats, and higher sugars. It should also be stated, too, that at the moment the \n","price of ingredients is actually higher and so what might have once seemed expensive for a tomato, or a stick of butter, \n","will seem even more expensive now,” she says. [12]\n","\n","Rents in some parts of Australia have risen as much as 42% on last year. [13] With a 7.3% rise in inflation in 2022, wages \n","in real terms fell 3.9% in Australia – the biggest fall on record, and there are fears of the heightened strain that will put \n","on the ability to eat healthily. [13] Countless studies show the link between the economy going down, and the quality of \n","our diets. [5]\n","\n","People eat less protein and green vegetables and more sugar and fatty foods during a recession, according to researchers \n","from Sacred Heart University who collected data from over 60,000 adults and children living in the US. They looked \n","at people’s diet and household food security before, during, and after the Great Recession of 2007 to 2010. [14] “The \n","COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented increases in food insecurity, and a dramatic increased need for \n","emergency food resources and other types of food assistance,” says Dr. Jacqueline Vernarelli, director of research \n","education and associate professor of public health at Sacred Heart.\n","\n","As people look to meal planning and reducing portion sizes to save money, the potential to lapse back into restrictive \n","eating habits or to develop disordered eating grows. There’s opportunity here to support people through these times by \n","finding ways to subsidise fresh, healthy food, motivate people to cook from scratch more, or to make ready meals and \n","pre-prepared alternatives that are lower in sugar and salt.\n","\n","(cid:0) 2023 Canvas8 Limited.

Even the boundary between work and home underwent a severe breach during \n","COVID-19 times. More social media and less socialising also meant that the ways we formed comparisons with people \n","and the ways we saw ourselves reflected completely changed over the course of the pandemic lockdowns, with no \n","warning and few resources around how to really manage such a social and personal shift.\n","\n","One-third of individuals using video calling throughout the pandemic have identified new areas of their appearance that \n","they dislike. [15]Add to this the already toxic culture of the online world: a shocking statistic is that half of all Australians \n","will be victims of online abuse, and the victims are disproportionately women and girls. [16]Eating disorders are most \n","prevalent among this demographic, making up almost two-thirds of those in Australia with eating disorders. [17]\n","\n","“The pandemic resulted in people spending more time online and on social media, and they were undoubtedly influenced \n","by stressful news coverage, weight stigmatising social media messaging like ‘COVID kilos’, and the pressures of toxic diet \n","culture that limits an individual’s worth to nothing more than their appearance,” says Nichols. “Body image issues emerged \n","from increased video calls as people were not used to seeing themselves on screen.” [1] The Summer of Kindness \n","campaign by the Butterfly Foundation aims to tackle body image issues, with tangible tips, advice, and resources on \n","negative diet culture while supporting positive body image and focusing on eating disorder recovery.

With more time at home, often \\nspent online scrutinising their looks, the lenses through which people see themselves has completely changed. And not \\nnecessarily for the better. Tania Nichols, a clinical psychologist and the clinical supervisor for Butterfly’s national helpline, \\nsays that the pandemic had a major impact on people’s mental health. “In 2020, contacts to Butterfly’s web chat support \\nservice increased by 116%,” she says. “School services have also seen a 150% increase in demand since the beginning \\nof 2021 (compared with 2020), reflecting the spike in students’ eating disorder and body image issues that schools are \\nidentifying.” [1] There was also, she says, a 63% increase in the volume of total contacts to Butterfly’s national helpline, \\ncompared with the year prior to the onset of the pandemic.\\n\\nIt started with video calls: hours looking at a (reverse) mirror created a new phenomenon dubbed ‘Zoom fatigue’ by \\nStanford University academics.

[2]\\n\\nThere were also all kinds of other emotional and physical disruptions: food insecurity, limited access to wellness spaces \\nlike the gym or even normal outdoor areas, and an increased amount of time spent on social media, looking at toxic \\nimages or forming parasocial and comparative relationships with strangers.

[3]\\n\\nNow faced with an economic downturn and a cost-of-living crisis – with rents in some parts of Australia rising as much as \\n42% on last year – there are fears that a heightened strain will be put on the ability to eat healthily. [4] After all, there are \\nstrong links between a suffering economy and worsening quality of people’s diets. [5] How will this state of permacrisis \\nput Australians at higher risk of health issues and negative thought patterns? And what can brands do to soften the \\nblows?\\n\\nCOVID-19 AND BODY IMAGE\\n\\nAnnual presentations of anorexia nervosa in Australia increased from 98.7 in 2017, to 161 in 2020, which represents an \\nincrease of 63%. The paper’s authors write: “The influx of patients with no apparent predisposing mental health or medical \\nconditions in 2020 suggests that many of these patients may have not otherwise developed an eating disorder given a \\nnormal year.” [6] Indeed, compared to before the pandemic, 74% of people reported increased food restriction, and 88% \\nhad experienced an increase in body image concerns. [7]\\n\\nHowever, it’s not just restrictive behaviours around food that thrived. Some 66% of Australians reported an increase in \\nbinge eating. [8] Already, binge eating disorders (BED) are the country’s most common form of eating disorder, despite the \\nfew people seeking help for it – or who even know they have it. In Australia, 47% of all people with an eating disorder have \\nBED, compared with 3% living with anorexia nervosa, 12% with bulimia nervosa, and 38% with other eating disorders, \\nand it’s as common in men as it is in women.\\n\\nAccording to studies from all over the world, changes in daily life because of the lockdowns had adverse consequences for \\npeople’s mental health – often including increases in ‘maladaptive eating habits and body dissatisfaction’. [9] “Contributing \\nfactors included disruption to food shopping and food availability, gyms being closed leading to fear around body changes, \\ninability to receive face-to-face support, home isolations, increased exposure to food which may have resulted in bingeing \\nor not eating, and comparison to others while being stuck at home,” says Nichols.

[10] Faced with an economic \\ndownturn and a cost-of-living crisis, it’s no wonder that people find it hard to stay healthy in what they eat and how they \\nstay active. Fresh food is expensive and time consuming to make, and people are increasingly tired from the more they \\nhave to work. Making fresh and healthy food may therefore be getting harder and harder to manage. [11]\\n\\n\"To make food from scratch is both time consuming and is financially harder too,” says Talia Carvajal – head pastry chef at \\nHart in Copenhagen. “While it’s proven that cooking from scratch, with all the right ingredients is, in the long run, more cost \\neffective because a lot of ingredients can be used time and time again, the mental effort it takes to work out how to cook \\na balanced meal, make something different with similar ingredients each night, finding the desire to eat leftovers often \\nseems like far more work than a pre-prepared meal, which is only marginally more expensive. Of course pre-prepared \\nmeals containhigher salt, higher saturated fats, and higher sugars. It should also be stated, too, that at the moment the \\nprice of ingredients is actually higher and so what might have once seemed expensive for a tomato, or a stick of butter, \\nwill seem even more expensive now,” she says. [12]\\n\\nRents in some parts of Australia have risen as much as 42% on last year. [13] With a 7.3% rise in inflation in 2022, wages \\nin real terms fell 3.9% in Australia – the biggest fall on record, and there are fears of the heightened strain that will put \\non the ability to eat healthily. [13] Countless studies show the link between the economy going down, and the quality of \\nour diets. [5]\\n\\nPeople eat less protein and green vegetables and more sugar and fatty foods during a recession, according to researchers \\nfrom Sacred Heart University who collected data from over 60,000 adults and children living in the US. They looked \\nat people’s diet and household food security before, during, and after the Great Recession of 2007 to 2010. [14] “The \\nCOVID-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented increases in food insecurity, and a dramatic increased need for \\nemergency food resources and other types of food assistance,” says Dr. Jacqueline Vernarelli, director of research \\neducation and associate professor of public health at Sacred Heart.\\n\\nAs people look to meal planning and reducing portion sizes to save money, the potential to lapse back into restrictive \\neating habits or to develop disordered eating grows. There’s opportunity here to support people through these times by \\nfinding ways to subsidise fresh, healthy food, motivate people to cook from scratch more, or to make ready meals and \\npre-prepared alternatives that are lower in sugar and salt.\\n\\n(cid:0) 2023 Canvas8 Limited.

Even the boundary between work and home underwent a severe breach during \\nCOVID-19 times. More social media and less socialising also meant that the ways we formed comparisons with people \\nand the ways we saw ourselves reflected completely changed over the course of the pandemic lockdowns, with no \\nwarning and few resources around how to really manage such a social and personal shift.\\n\\nOne-third of individuals using video calling throughout the pandemic have identified new areas of their appearance that \\nthey dislike. [15]Add to this the already toxic culture of the online world: a shocking statistic is that half of all Australians \\nwill be victims of online abuse, and the victims are disproportionately women and girls. [16]Eating disorders are most \\nprevalent among this demographic, making up almost two-thirds of those in Australia with eating disorders. [17]\\n\\n“The pandemic resulted in people spending more time online and on social media, and they were undoubtedly influenced \\nby stressful news coverage, weight stigmatising social media messaging like ‘COVID kilos’, and the pressures of toxic diet \\nculture that limits an individual’s worth to nothing more than their appearance,” says Nichols. “Body image issues emerged \\nfrom increased video calls as people were not used to seeing themselves on screen.” [1] The Summer of Kindness \\ncampaign by the Butterfly Foundation aims to tackle body image issues, with tangible tips, advice, and resources on \\nnegative diet culture while supporting positive body image and focusing on eating disorder recovery. It chimed with hotter \\nweather in Australia, which is a time when people dealing with body image issues hyper-focus on their body and feelings \\nof social anxiety are intensified.\\n\\n(cid:0) 2023 Canvas8 Limited.

There’s an overwhelming crisis in mental health \\nissues such as negative body image and eating disorders, and a lack of adequate provision of care and professional help. \\n“Organisations should be committed to understanding mental health conditions and illnesses including eating disorders \\nand strive to support those struggling compassionately and effectively,” says Nichols. “More broadly, organisations \\nshould offer initiatives to support their employees’ mental health including but not limited to accessible resources and \\nsupport services.” [1] The Body Image Movement, based in Adelaide, creates educational resources, award-winning \\ndocumentaries, and books, as well as organising speaking events to promote positive body image, combat toxic \\nmessaging in media and advertising and educate its global community physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health.\\n\\nENGAGING WITH ISSUES OF FOOD POVERTY\\n\\nEconomic disadvantage as a result of the pandemic is fuelling a rise in eating disorders, because Australians can’t afford \\nto eat how they want. This often means restrictive measures like smaller portions to save money, or it means finding \\ncheaper alternatives which often contain higher levels of sugars and salts. The Staples Bag Camperdown, inner Sydney’s \\nfirst low-cost grocer to provide high-quality nutritious food, aimed to support the community, and help those with low \\nincome or lower access to employment be able to afford food. Sadly, it permanently closed in 2022, so there is space in \\nthis area for a community focussed arm. There’s also space here for brands to offer helpful tips on how to make meals \\non a budget, or as cost effectively as possible. The app Yummly makes recipe selection and shopping super easy – after \\nselecting a recipe choice, the app configures a shopping list and enables shoppers to spread the same ingredients over \\na period of time.\\n\\n(cid:0) 2023 Canvas8 Limited.

With 60% of young girls in Australia wishing they had more information about how to avoid or deal with \\nidealised beauty content, Dove and the Butterfly Foundation created a #DetoxYourFeed campaign, featuring afour-step \\nguide to help parents talk to kids about toxic beauty standards that are so prevalent on social media. [3] While promotion \\nof positive body image is important, so is turning the focus away from appearance entirely.“The [onlineAn Eating Disorder \\nLooks Like Me aimed to demonstrate that eating disorders have no particular look and anyone irrespective of age, gender, \\nsexuality, cultural background, or size can experience an eating disorder,” says Nichols. “Breaking down these harmful \\nstereotypes will encourage more people to come forward to get the help they need and deserve.” [1]\\n\\n(cid:0) 2023 Canvas8 Limited.

[2] there were also all kinds of other emotional and physical disruptions: food insecurity, limited access to wellness spaces like the gym or even normal outdoor areas, and an increased amount of time spent on social media, looking at toxic images or forming parasocial and comparative relationships with strangers. according to doves self-esteem project, (cid:0) 2023 canvas8 limited. all rights reserved. neither this article nor any part of it may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any ahyyusrcieeusyrcsbyormrhyyusdgsbyomgip form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise, without the prior permission of canvas8 limited. u doutrmrpyrh2rp9parr03r2wrahyy2eusyrhsrtusyyrrlin3ruptwrg2uyuyb 52% of girls in australia say they constantly check how they look in photos and wish they looked better and 48% reveal they often wish they looked like someone else. [3] now faced with an economic downturn and a cost-of-living crisis with rents in some parts of australia rising as much as 42% on last year there are fears that a heightened strain will be put on the ability to eat healthily. [4] after all, there are strong links between a suffering economy and worsening quality of peoples diets. [5] how will this state of permacrisis put australians at higher risk of health issues and negative thought patterns? and what can brands do to soften the blows? covid-19 and body image annual presentations of anorexia nervosa in australia increased from 98.7 in 2017, to 161 in 2020, which represents an increase of 63%. the papers authors write: the influx of patients with no apparent predisposing mental health or medical conditions in 2020 suggests that many of these patients may have not otherwise developed an eating disorder given a normal year. [6] indeed, compared to before the pandemic, 74% of people reported increased food restriction, and 88% had experienced an increase in body image concerns. [7] however, its not just restrictive behaviours around food that thrived. some 66% of australians reported an increase in binge eating. [8] already, binge eating disorders (bed) are the countrys most common form of eating disorder, despite the few people seeking help for it or who even know they have it. in australia, 47% of all people with an eating disorder have bed, compared with 3% living with anorexia nervosa, 12% with bulimia nervosa, and 38% with other eating disorders, and its as common in men as it is in women. according to studies from all over the world, changes in daily life because of the lockdowns had adverse consequences for peoples mental health often including increases in maladaptive eating habits and body dissatisfaction. [9] contributing factors included disruption to food shopping and food availability, gyms being closed leading to fear around body changes, inability to receive face-to-face support, home isolations, increased exposure to food which may have resulted in bingeing or not eating, and comparison to others while being stuck at home, says nichols.

[10] faced with an economic downturn and a cost-of-living crisis, its no wonder that people find it hard to stay healthy in what they eat and how they stay active. fresh food is expensive and time consuming to make, and people are increasingly tired from the more they have to work. making fresh and healthy food may therefore be getting harder and harder to manage. [11] \"to make food from scratch is both time consuming and is financially harder too, says talia carvajal head pastry chef at hart in copenhagen. while its proven that cooking from scratch, with all the right ingredients is, in the long run, more cost effective because a lot of ingredients can be used time and time again, the mental effort it takes to work out how to cook a balanced meal, make something different with similar ingredients each night, finding the desire to eat leftovers often seems like far more work than a pre-prepared meal, which is only marginally more expensive. of course pre-prepared meals containhigher salt, higher saturated fats, and higher sugars. it should also be stated, too, that at the moment the price of ingredients is actually higher and so what might have once seemed expensive for a tomato, or a stick of butter, will seem even more expensive now, she says. [12] rents in some parts of australia have risen as much as 42% on last year. [13] with a 7.3% rise in inflation in 2022, wages in real terms fell 3.9% in australia the biggest fall on record, and there are fears of the heightened strain that will put on the ability to eat healthily. [13] countless studies show the link between the economy going down, and the quality of our diets. [5] people eat less protein and green vegetables and more sugar and fatty foods during a recession, according to researchers from sacred heart university who collected data from over 60,000 adults and children living in the us. they looked at peoples diet and household food security before, during, and after the great recession of 2007 to 2010. [14] the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented increases in food insecurity, and a dramatic increased need for emergency food resources and other types of food assistance, says dr. jacqueline vernarelli, director of research education and associate professor of public health at sacred heart. as people look to meal planning and reducing portion sizes to save money, the potential to lapse back into restrictive eating habits or to develop disordered eating grows. theres opportunity here to support people through these times by finding ways to subsidise fresh, healthy food, motivate people to cook from scratch more, or to make ready meals and pre-prepared alternatives that are lower in sugar and salt.

[15]add to this the already toxic culture of the online world: a shocking statistic is that half of all australians will be victims of online abuse, and the victims are disproportionately women and girls. [16]eating disorders are most prevalent among this demographic, making up almost two-thirds of those in australia with eating disorders. [17] the pandemic resulted in people spending more time online and on social media, and they were undoubtedly influenced by stressful news coverage, weight stigmatising social media messaging like covid kilos, and the pressures of toxic diet culture that limits an individuals worth to nothing more than their appearance, says nichols. body image issues emerged from increased video calls as people were not used to seeing themselves on screen. [1] the summer of kindness campaign by the butterfly foundation aims to tackle body image issues, with tangible tips, advice, and resources on negative diet culture while supporting positive body image and focusing on eating disorder recovery. it chimed with hotter weather in australia, which is a time when people dealing with body image issues hyper-focus on their body and feelings of social anxiety are intensified.

[1] the body image movement, based in adelaide, creates educational resources, award-winning documentaries, and books, as well as organising speaking events to promote positive body image, combat toxic messaging in media and advertising and educate its global community physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. engaging with issues of food poverty economic disadvantage as a result of the pandemic is fuelling a rise in eating disorders, because australians cant afford to eat how they want. this often means restrictive measures like smaller portions to save money, or it means finding cheaper alternatives which often contain higher levels of sugars and salts. the staples bag camperdown, inner sydneys first low-cost grocer to provide high-quality nutritious food, aimed to support the community, and help those with low income or lower access to employment be able to afford food. sadly, it permanently closed in 2022, so there is space in this area for a community focussed arm. theres also space here for brands to offer helpful tips on how to make meals on a budget, or as cost effectively as possible. the app yummly makes recipe selection and shopping super easy after selecting a recipe choice, the app configures a shopping list and enables shoppers to spread the same ingredients over a period of time.

afford healthy food and find time to cook it increased time spent online has meant that peoples self-esteem and body confidence have been negatively affected compared to before the pandemic, 74% of

scrutinising their looks, the lenses through which people see themselves has completely changed. and not necessarily for the better. tania nichols, a clinical psychologist and the clinical supervisor for butterflys national helpline, says that the pandemic had a major impact on peoples mental health. in 2020, contacts to butterflys web chat support service increased by 116%, she says. school services have also seen a 150% increase in demand since the beginning of 2021 (compared with 2020), reflecting the spike in students eating disorder and body image issues that schools are identifying. [1] there was also, she says, a 63% increase in the volume of total contacts to butterflys national helpline, compared with the year prior to the onset of the pandemic. it started with video calls: hours looking at a (reverse) mirror created a new phenomenon dubbed zoom fatigue by stanford university academics. it compares all the hours we spent using video calling forums in the pandemic to someone following you around with a mirror, and the stanford findings explain that when people are shown a mirror, they become much more critical of our appearance, as opposed to when asked to describe our appearance without one. [2] there were also all kinds of other emotional and physical disruptions: food insecurity, limited access to wellness spaces like the gym or even normal outdoor areas, and an increased amount of time spent on social media, looking at toxic images or forming parasocial and comparative relationships with strangers. according to doves self-esteem project, (cid:0) 2023 canvas8 limited. all rights reserved. neither this article nor any part of it may be reproduced, stored in a retrieval system, or transmitted in any ahyyusrcieeusyrcsbyormrhyyusdgsbyomgip form or by any means, electronic, mechanical, photocopying, recording or otherwise, without the prior permission of canvas8 limited. u doutrmrpyrh2rp9parr03r2wrahyy2eusyrhsrtusyyrrlin3ruptwrg2uyuyb 52% of girls in australia say they constantly check how they look in photos and wish they looked better and 48% reveal they often wish they looked like someone else. [3] now faced with an economic downturn and a cost-of-living crisis with rents in some parts of australia rising as much as 42% on last year there are fears that a heightened strain will be put on the ability to eat healthily. [4] after all, there are strong links between a suffering economy and worsening quality of peoples diets. [5] how will this state of permacrisis put australians at higher risk of health issues and negative thought patterns? and what can brands do to soften the blows? covid-19 and body image annual presentations of anorexia nervosa in australia increased from 98.7 in 2017, to 161 in 2020, which represents an increase of 63%. the papers authors write: the influx of patients with no apparent predisposing mental health or medical conditions in 2020 suggests that many of these patients may have not otherwise developed an eating disorder given a normal year. [6] indeed, compared to before the pandemic, 74% of people reported increased food restriction, and 88% had experienced an increase in body image concerns. [7] however, its not just restrictive behaviours around food that thrived. some 66% of australians reported an increase in binge eating. [8] already, binge eating disorders (bed) are the countrys most common form of eating disorder, despite the few people seeking help for it or who even know they have it. in australia, 47% of all people with an eating disorder have bed, compared with 3% living with anorexia nervosa, 12% with bulimia nervosa, and 38% with other eating disorders, and its as common in men as it is in women. according to studies from all over the world, changes in daily life because of the lockdowns had adverse consequences for peoples mental health often including increases in maladaptive eating habits and body dissatisfaction. [9] contributing factors included disruption to food shopping and food availability, gyms being closed leading to fear around body changes, inability to receive face-to-face support, home isolations, increased exposure to food which may have resulted in bingeing or not eating, and comparison to others while being stuck at home, says nichols.

[10] faced with an economic downturn and a cost-of-living crisis, its no wonder that people find it hard to stay healthy in what they eat and how they stay active. fresh food is expensive and time consuming to make, and people are increasingly tired from the more they have to work. making fresh and healthy food may therefore be getting harder and harder to manage. [11] \"to make food from scratch is both time consuming and is financially harder too, says talia carvajal head pastry chef at hart in copenhagen. while its proven that cooking from scratch, with all the right ingredients is, in the long run, more cost effective because a lot of ingredients can be used time and time again, the mental effort it takes to work out how to cook a balanced meal, make something different with similar ingredients each night, finding the desire to eat leftovers often seems like far more work than a pre-prepared meal, which is only marginally more expensive. of course pre-prepared meals containhigher salt, higher saturated fats, and higher sugars. it should also be stated, too, that at the moment the price of ingredients is actually higher and so what might have once seemed expensive for a tomato, or a stick of butter, will seem even more expensive now, she says. [12] rents in some parts of australia have risen as much as 42% on last year. [13] with a 7.3% rise in inflation in 2022, wages in real terms fell 3.9% in australia the biggest fall on record, and there are fears of the heightened strain that will put on the ability to eat healthily. [13] countless studies show the link between the economy going down, and the quality of our diets. [5] people eat less protein and green vegetables and more sugar and fatty foods during a recession, according to researchers from sacred heart university who collected data from over 60,000 adults and children living in the us. they looked at peoples diet and household food security before, during, and after the great recession of 2007 to 2010. [14] the covid-19 pandemic has resulted in unprecedented increases in food insecurity, and a dramatic increased need for emergency food resources and other types of food assistance, says dr. jacqueline vernarelli, director of research education and associate professor of public health at sacred heart. as people look to meal planning and reducing portion sizes to save money, the potential to lapse back into restrictive eating habits or to develop disordered eating grows. theres opportunity here to support people through these times by finding ways to subsidise fresh, healthy food, motivate people to cook from scratch more, or to make ready meals and pre-prepared alternatives that are lower in sugar and salt.

[15]add to this the already toxic culture of the online world: a shocking statistic is that half of all australians will be victims of online abuse, and the victims are disproportionately women and girls. [16]eating disorders are most prevalent among this demographic, making up almost two-thirds of those in australia with eating disorders. [17] the pandemic resulted in people spending more time online and on social media, and they were undoubtedly influenced by stressful news coverage, weight stigmatising social media messaging like covid kilos, and the pressures of toxic diet culture that limits an individuals worth to nothing more than their appearance, says nichols. body image issues emerged from increased video calls as people were not used to seeing themselves on screen. [1] the summer of kindness campaign by the butterfly foundation aims to tackle body image issues, with tangible tips, advice, and resources on negative diet culture while supporting positive body image and focusing on eating disorder recovery. it chimed with hotter weather in australia, which is a time when people dealing with body image issues hyper-focus on their body and feelings of social anxiety are intensified.

[1] the body image movement, based in adelaide, creates educational resources, award-winning documentaries, and books, as well as organising speaking events to promote positive body image, combat toxic messaging in media and advertising and educate its global community physical, mental, emotional, and spiritual health. engaging with issues of food poverty economic disadvantage as a result of the pandemic is fuelling a rise in eating disorders, because australians cant afford to eat how they want. this often means restrictive measures like smaller portions to save money, or it means finding cheaper alternatives which often contain higher levels of sugars and salts. the staples bag camperdown, inner sydneys first low-cost grocer to provide high-quality nutritious food, aimed to support the community, and help those with low income or lower access to employment be able to afford food. sadly, it permanently closed in 2022, so there is space in this area for a community focussed arm. theres also space here for brands to offer helpful tips on how to make meals on a budget, or as cost effectively as possible. the app yummly makes recipe selection and shopping super easy after selecting a recipe choice, the app configures a shopping list and enables shoppers to spread the same ingredients over a period of time.
